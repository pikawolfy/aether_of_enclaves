# Homework 7

[Latest Commit]()

[Version 0.1.0 Release](https://github.com/swamulism/aether_of_enclaves/releases/tag/0.1.0)

1. What was planned for this deadline, from our check-in before break:
     - We want to make the world generation a bit more advanced - this is intentionally vague, because this could head in a number of directions.
    - We'd like to have the main character move on the world itself (move from ship to world and back).
    - Finish the item interaction mentioned above (picking them up, throwing them).
    - Rewrite a large number of comments and tests, as the large number of updates how outdated a lot of these.

2. What was accomplished:
    - Everything

3. Planned for next deadline:
    - There is no deadline
